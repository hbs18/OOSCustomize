# OOSCustomize 2.0

OOSCustomize 2.0 is a Substratum theme made for OnePlus' OxygenOS 5.0 release, based on Android 8.0. This repository is for archival purposes only, this was made a long time ago and will not receive updates.

#### What does it do?

Since the release of Android 7.1-based OxygenOS 4.5.0, OnePlus did a substantial rework of the system's theme, straying away from the stock AOSP look OxygenOS was always loved for. This theme adjusts various style properties of OOS 5.0 apps and system UI to make them look and feel more like their AOSP counterparts. 

OOSCustomize 2.0 also lets you customize things like the status bar clock position, system accent colors and the number of tiles in the quick settings menu. A fix for a fully monochrome ambient display is also included in this theme.
